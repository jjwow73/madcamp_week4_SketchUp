### :beginner: Rules
:one: Each player is given a drawing book and a marker.  
:two: At the start of each round, every player is given a card with a list of secret words.  
:three: The players then have fifteen seconds to draw their word on page one of their drawing book.  
:four: Once the fifteen seconds have passed, the players pass their books to the player on their left.  
:five: On page two, the players guess what has been drawn on page one of the book that was passed to them.  
:six: Once all players have written their guesses, they turn their books to page three and again pass their books to the left.  
:seven: Players continue to draw and guess until they have their original books back.
