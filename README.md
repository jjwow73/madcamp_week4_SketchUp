<< Sketchup >>

1. What is Sketchup?
Sketchup is a party game in which players are prompted to sketch a word listed on a card, 
then guess what the other players have drawn.

2. Rule: Each player is given a drawing book and a marker. 
At the start of each round, every player is given a card with a list of secret words.
The players then have fifteen seconds to draw their word on page one of their drawing book.
Once the fifteen seconds have passed, the players pass their books to the player on their left.
On page two, the players guess what has been drawn on page one of the book that was passed to them.
Once all players have written their guesses, they turn their books to page three and again pass their books to the left.
Players continue to draw and guess until they have their original books back.
